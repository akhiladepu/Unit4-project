## End Notes

In this project we were tried to achieve a near to perfect clone of the design given by our UXD team of Masai School. This entire journey of this construct week has given us experiences and we have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence. Most of the features are added and functionality of the website is achieved.
